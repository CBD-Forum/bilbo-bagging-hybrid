# Models Architectures

Each file contains the Keras code and a brief description of how it was developed in the paper. All model development done in Python 3.7

Please reach out to Kate Highnam at kwh19@ic.ac.uk with any questions.

## Constants 

For all iterations of the models, these were the values for the constants within the model code:

```
max_epoch = 10
batch_size = 512
MAX_INDEX = 42 # Max number of valid characters in a domain
MAX_STRING_LENGTH = 63
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION = 128
NUM_CONV_FILTERS = 60
```
